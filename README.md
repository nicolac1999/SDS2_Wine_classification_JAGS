# SDS2_Wine_classification_JAGS

## Wine quality classification from a Frequentist and a Bayesian point of view

The purpose of this project is to develop an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis(using MCMC simulation) to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests such as :
- fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.

The output variable is the quality good or bad based on these physicochemical properties. 

The project contains also an illustration of the features of the MCMC convergence diagnostics and error control, an analysis to recover model parameters with data simulated from the model adn a comparison with frequentist inference.
