# SDS2_Wine_classification_JAGS

## Wine quality classification from a Frequentist and a Bayesian point of view

The purpose of this project is to develop an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests such as :
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
The output variable is the quality good or bad based on these physicochemical properties.
